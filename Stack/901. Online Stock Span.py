# --- Dry Run for Stack Approach ---
# For price = 70 (when the sequence is [100, 80, 60, 70]):
# 1. After processing 100, 80, 60:
#    Stack = [(100, 1), (80, 1), (60, 1)]
# 2. Process 70:
#    - span = 1
#    - Top of stack is (60, 1) and 60 <= 70, so pop it and add span: span becomes 2.
#    - Now top is (80, 1) and 80 > 70, so stop.
#    - Push (70, 2) â†’ Stack becomes [(100, 1), (80, 1), (70, 2)]
# 3. Return span = 2.
